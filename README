==================
I divided the project to function this way:

the first 5 functions is the changing file options:
reverse- A function that receives a list of lists and returns a new list
    containing the lists from the original list in reversed order.
speed_acceleration - A function that receives a list of lists and returns a new list
    containing only the lists that have even indexes.
speed_deceasing- A function that receives a list of lists and returns a new list containing
    the original lists from the big list and between every original list there is a new
    list composed from the average of the lists before and after her.
volume_turn_up_or_down- A function that receives a list of lists and returns a new list
    containing the original values times 1.2 or divide by 1.2 depend on the users input.
low_pass_filter - A function that receives a list of lists and returns a new list containing the average
    of the value, the one before him and the one after him for each value in the original list.

the next function combines all the changing options:
change_wav_file - A function that operates the change file menu, and changes the file
    according to the users input.

the next 4 functions relate to the combine files option:
combine_equal_len_and_rate - A function that combines two audios data that has the same length and
    frame rate, the new audio data will be the average of each value from the original values.
combine_equal_rate_not_len - A function that combines two audios data that has the same frame rate
    but different length, the new audio data will be the average of each value from the original
    values and then the extra values left in the longest audio data will be added.
create_new_audio_by_rate - A function that create new audio data for the longer frame rate- creates
    new list composed only from the (short frame rate/ gc) values from each (long frame rate / gcd)
    values.
combine_audio - A function that combines two audios according to their length and frame rates.

the next function is the combine menu:
combine_files_menu - A function that asks for 2 file names to combine and operates the
    combine functions.

the next 3 functions relate to the composing option:
frequency_by_letter- A function that receives a note and returns its frequency.
composing_calculate- A function that receives a note and play time and returns the matching
    audio data list according to the formula.
read_composing_file- A function that receives the composing file and returns a list of all
    the values.

the next function composing menu:
composing- A function that asks for instruction file name and creates the audio
    data according to the instructions.

the final 2 functions are the menus of the project:
pass_menu- A function that operates the pass menu which saves a wav file or changes
    one by moving the file to the change menu.
entrance_menu- A function that operates the entrance menu- the user will enter a number
    of action and the function will summon the matching action.
